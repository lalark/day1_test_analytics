# day1_test_analytics
This is where I am learning how to create a new repository.
<br>
My goals for this class are:
*getting comfortable in the terminal
*figuring out where to look for datasets
*how to establish if dataset is usable, and lean how to make messy datasets clean
*hot to do things the *right* way so that others can use my work
